# Python DataViz

Making (data) visualization in Python fun, attractive, and beautiful.

The visualization are structured in **notebooks**, each with a particular topic.
(It is somewhat unstructured now. The idea is, however, to improve the organization drastically ... but, in the future
)

Often the visualizations are somewhat related to deep learning (e.g., embeddings, clusters, layer activations, input representations, training and learning curves, image and image transformations)

Explored libraries
:
- `matplotlib` (mostly)
- `seaborn`
- `open-cv`
- `skimage`
- `newtorkx` (for graphs)
- machine learning: `pytorch` and `pytorch geometric`
